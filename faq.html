            "The term furry describes a diverse community of fans, artists, writers, gamers, and role players. 
            Most furries create for themselves an anthropomorphized animal character 
            (fursona) with whom they identify and can function as an avatar within the community. 
            Furry fandom is an inclusive term that describes the community of furries that span online, local, and international settings. 
            The furry fandom is global, with hundreds of local groups existing worldwide and dozens of conventions held annually."

          Furry is something I have been interested in since I stumbled upon it online in 2018. There is tons of infomration online about the
          community, and if you are at all curious I recommend doing some research! I have made a lot of great friends and it's a very fun 
          and creative outlet for me personally. It's not for everyone but I enjoy it! You do not have to be a furry to enjoy the related art 
          and/or costume~! Art is something everyone can enjoy and appreciate in their own way.<span style="color: #3EADDC;">  To me, furry is a fashion style, creative outlet, community,
        and hobby. It takes a lot to try to learn about and understand new or odd things, I appreciate anyone who takes the time to make this effort, so thank you! :3</span>
